![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feltron/Processing_GPXMapMosaic/master/13 - 45 - 56.png)

## To Use
- Login to your account on Strava.com
- From the main drop-down menu at the top of all Strava pages (under your name) select "Settings". From the lower right of the screen, select "Download all your activities"
- Once you have received the archive of GPX files from Strava, unzip the archive and move all of them in to the "data" folder of this sketch.
- Once you run the Processing sketch, it will take a little while to index all the routes and geocode the regions. Progress will be output to the console.

## Notes
- This sketch has not been tested with more than 500 GPX files or with cycle data.
- The data folder comes pre-populated with 1 GPX file so that it will run if you do not have data of your own.
